Absolutely — you can dramatically improve load times for your Leptos + WASM rich text editor by leveraging browser caching, smarter bundling, and persistent client-side storage. Google Docs is slow because it’s massive and JS-heavy — your app doesn’t have to be.

Here’s a complete breakdown of strategies to make your editor feel instantaneous:

⸻

🚀 1. Cache the WASM binary (and JS glue)

✅ Use HTTP caching headers

Make sure your server (or CDN) sets long-lived Cache-Control headers on these files:
	•	app_bg.wasm (your compiled WASM module)
	•	app.js (wasm-bindgen JS glue)
	•	style.css, font atlas, texture atlases, etc.

Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

✅ This means after first load, all static assets come from disk cache (no network) — super fast.

📦 2. Use Trunk with hashed filenames

Trunk generates index-xxxx.js and app-xxxx.wasm with content hashes — perfect for caching.
	•	Users always get the latest version if the hash changes
	•	Otherwise, the browser reuses the cached file

trunk build --release


⸻

📂 3. Use IndexedDB for persistent font + glyph atlas caching
	•	On first load: generate font atlas or SDFs from fontdue + sdf_glyph_renderer
	•	Save result (texture data + glyph metadata) to IndexedDB
	•	On future loads: skip generation — load atlas directly from cache and upload to GPU

🔧 Use the idb crate or JS interop to read/write binary blobs to IndexedDB.

🔁 4. Lazy-load content

Avoid loading entire documents up front:
	•	Load only visible pages/blocks (virtualized rendering)
	•	Keep large docs as compressed blocks in IndexedDB or Supabase
	•	Fetch on scroll or command

⸻

🧵 5. Defer heavy setup
	•	Defer shader compilation, atlas uploads, and render passes until after first paint
	•	Show a working UI with static canvas or loading state
	•	Use requestIdleCallback() or wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local for post-load work

⸻

⚙️ 6. WebGPU warm-up

WebGPU can delay rendering a few frames while it compiles pipelines. Mitigate that by:
	•	Creating pipelines and shaders at startup during idle time
	•	Reusing them instead of rebuilding
	•	Keeping atlas textures alive and reused across sessions

⸻

🧠 7. Pre-render static content server-side (optional)

With Leptos SSR (via leptos_actix or leptos_axum), you can serve:
	•	Fully rendered HTML up front
	•	Client-side WASM hydrates it after load

Fast Time to First Byte + smooth hydration.

⸻

🧨 8. Minimize WASM binary size
	•	Use trunk build --release
	•	Enable opt-level = "z" or "s" in Cargo.toml
	•	Use strip or wasm-opt -Oz to compress final binary
	•	Serve with Brotli or Gzip

⸻

✨ Combined, this gives you:

Feature	Achieved by
Instant page load	SSR + WASM caching + IndexedDB
No layout delay	Cache glyph atlas, reuse buffers
Fast text rendering	SDF + WebGPU batching
Reopen documents instantly	Load from local storage (IndexedDB)
Tiny network payloads	Hashed + compressed static assets


⸻

✅ TL;DR

You can make your Leptos+WASM editor load way faster than Google Docs by:

	•	Caching the WASM + JS glue with proper headers
	•	Storing glyph atlas and assets in IndexedDB
	•	Compressing and hashing builds
	•	Avoiding unnecessary computation/render on first load
