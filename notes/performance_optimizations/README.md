# Performance Optimizations for Leptos WebGPU Editor

This folder contains code and configurations for optimizing the initial load time of the text editor.

## Files

- `cache_manager.rs` - IndexedDB font atlas caching system
- `deferred_init.rs` - Deferred WebGPU initialization for faster startup
- `serve.rs` - HTTP server configuration for optimal caching headers

## Implementation Status

These optimizations are **not currently implemented** in the main codebase. They were moved here to focus on other features first.

## When to Implement

Consider implementing these optimizations when:
- The editor functionality is complete
- Load time becomes a noticeable issue
- You want to deploy for production use

## Expected Benefits

- **Time to First Paint**: ~200-500ms (from 2-3s)
- **WASM Size**: ~400-600KB (from 1.2MB)
- **Repeat Visits**: Near-instant loading from cache
- **Font Atlas Load**: Cached across sessions

## Implementation Order

1. WASM size optimization (already configured in Cargo.toml/Trunk.toml)
2. HTTP caching headers
3. Deferred WebGPU initialization
4. IndexedDB font atlas caching
5. Lazy loading of heavy operations
